# NORMAL DISTRIBUTION - CUMULATIVE PROBABILITY

# Enter the mean, ì, and the standard deviation, ó, of the distribution:

mean = 4
st.dev = 1

# Enter the value, a, of the upper limit of x:

a = 3

# The cumulative probability that x will have a value between 0 and a is:

pnorm(a, mean, st.dev)
