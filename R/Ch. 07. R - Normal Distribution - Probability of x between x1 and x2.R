# NORMAL DISTRIBUTION - PROBABILITY OF x BETWEEN x1 AND x2

# Enter the mean, ?, and the standard deviation, ?, of the distribution:

mean = 4
st.dev = 1

# Enter the values of the limits of x:

x1 = 3
x2 = 5

# The probability that x will have a value between x1 and x2:

pnorm(x2, mean, st.dev) - pnorm(x1, mean, st.dev)
