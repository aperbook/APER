# R - BINOMIAL DISTRIBUTION - CUMULATIVE PROBABILITY

# Enter the following values:

number.of.trials = 10
probability.of.success = 0.5
maximum.number.of.successes = 5

# Evaluation

n = number.of.trials
p = probability.of.success
x = maximum.number.of.successes
P = pbinom(x, n, p)

# Probability P(x) that the number of successes is less than or equal to x is:      

P
