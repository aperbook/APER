# NORMAL DISTRIBUTION - PROBABILITY DENSITY FUNCTION

# Enter the mean, ì, and the standard deviation, ó, of the distribution:

mean = 4
st.dev = 1

# Enter the value of x at which the value of the probability density function is required:

x = 3

# The value at x of the probability density function f(x) is:

dnorm(x, mean, st.dev)
